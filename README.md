**Goal:** To help this drinks brand secure further investment by creating useful metrics to be presented to potential investors.

**Description:** This drinks brand needed to understand more about some key metrics. These included customer lifetime value, repeat customer numbers and the discounts used. These were requested by potential investors who wanted this information to understand the potential of the brand to grow. 

**Conclusion:** I created some visualisations that were presented to the investors who ultimately decided to support the business based on the information I provided.
